TAKE HOME - iOS Coding Challenge

Please write a native iOS app that allows users to browse recipes using the following API:
https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

There are 2 endpoints that your app should utilize:
1. https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert for fetching the list of meals in the Dessert category.
2. https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID for fetching the meal details by its ID. The user should be shown the list of meals in the Dessert category, sorted alphabetically.

When the user selects a meal, they should be taken to a detail view that includes:
1. Meal name
2. Instructions
3. Ingredients/measurements
